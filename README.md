# Formspree

Formspree is a service that allows you to easily set up and manage forms on your website. It simplifies the process of creating and handling forms without requiring you to set up a server or backend infrastructure. With Formspree, you can add a simple HTML form to your website and specify an action attribute that points to Formspree's endpoint. When users submit the form, Formspree processes the data and sends it to the specified email address.

Here's a basic overview of how Formspree works:

1. **Create HTML Form**: Design your form using HTML on your website. Specify the **`action`** attribute in the **`<form>`** tag to point to Formspree's endpoint.
    
    ```html
    htmlCopy code
    <form action="https://formspree.io/your-email@example.com" method="POST">
        <!-- Your form fields go here -->
        <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name">
        <input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your Email">
        <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message"></textarea>
        <input type="submit" value="Send">
    </form>
    
    ```
    
2. **Configure Formspree**: Replace **`"your-email@example.com"`** with your actual email address in the **`action`** attribute. Formspree will send form submissions to this email.
3. **Handle Submissions**: Formspree automatically handles form submissions and sends them to your specified email address. You'll receive an email notification for each form submission.

Formspree offers both free and paid plans with additional features such as customization, spam protection, and more. It's a convenient solution for website owners who want a quick and easy way to set up forms without dealing with server-side scripting. Keep in mind that as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there might have been updates or changes to Formspree, so it's a good idea to check their official website for the latest information.
